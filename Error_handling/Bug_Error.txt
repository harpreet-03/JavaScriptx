Error: An Error causes a program to strop running

Here are some of the most common errors in JavaScript: 

ReferenceError 
SyntaxError 
TypeError 
RangeError

1. ReferenceError: 
A ReferenceError gets thrown when, for example, one tries to use variables that haven't been declared anywhere.

2. SyntaxError
Any kind of invalid JavaScript code will cause a SyntaxError.

3. TypeError
A TypeError is thrown when, for example, trying to run a method on a non-supported data type.

Eg: 
A simple example is attempting to run the pop() method on a string:
"hello".pop() // Uncaught TypeError: "hello".pop is not a function

as can be confirmed by running the above line of code, strings do not have all the array methods readily available to them, and trying to use some of those methods will result in a TypeError being thrown.  


4. RangeError
A RangeError is thrown when we're giving a value to a function, but that value is out of the allowed range of acceptable input values.

For example:

1. (10).toString(2); // '1010'
The value of 2 when passed to the toString() method, is like saying to JavaScript: "convert the value of 10 of the Base 10 number system, to its counter-part in the Base 2 number system".
JavaScript obliges and "translates" the "regular" number 10 to its binary counter-part.
Besides using Base 2 number system, I can also use the Base 8, like this:
2. (10).toString(8); // 12


3.
However, if I try to use a non-existing number system, such as an imaginary Base 100, since this number system effectively doesn't exist in JavaScript, I will get the RangeError, because a non-existing Base 100 system is out of range of the number systems that are available to the toString() method:
(10).toString(100); // Uncaught RangeError: toString() radix argument must be between 2 and 36
